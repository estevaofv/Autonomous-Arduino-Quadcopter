Autonomous-Arduino-Quadcopter - Kevin Sheridan
=============================

This is my code for my autonomous Arduino powered quadcopter

-Created by Kevin Sheridan-
If you have any questions feel free to message me.

// GUI is made in Processing
// Quadcopter Main is made for arduino based microcontrollers

Quadcopter_Main = flight controller // GUI = Ground Station GUI // Flight Vizor = data playback program

//---------Version 2---------------------------------------
This version is similar to the old version but it now has added SLAM, pathfinding, computer vision, and curiosity to the quadcopter.

This contains both arduino and raspberry pi code.
